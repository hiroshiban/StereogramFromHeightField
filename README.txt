These are simple sample MATLAB codes to generate a Red-Green/Red-Cyan/Dual
Random-Dot-Stereogram (RDS) image from an input height map.

The main script is
~/StereogramFromHeightField/heightfield2RDS/generateRDS.m.

All the required files are included in the repository.
Please simply run and try whether you can get the RDS from a height field map.

Please change #line 22 if you want to process your own height field map.


The similar processing was used to generate RDS stimuli used in
Idy W. Y. Chou, Hiroshi Ban, Dorita H. F. Chang (2021).
