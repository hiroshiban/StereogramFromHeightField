These are simple sample MATLAB codes to generate a Red-Green/Red-Cyan/Dual
Random-Dot-Stereogram (RDS) image from an input height map.

The main script is
~/StereogramFromHeightField/heightfield2RDS/generateRDS.m.

All the required files are included in the repository.
Please simply run and try whether you can get the RDS from a height field map.

Please change #line 22 if you want to process your own height field map.
